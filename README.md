# js-weather-app
I wanted to create a website which recieved and displayed data from an API.

This application gets data from the [open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com)

The HTML and CSS were kept straightforward because the main priority with this project was to connect to an external API and parse the information in a user-friendly way

I used 'VITE' for this project so that I could import and export functions across js files. This was because I wanted to keep the function which determines which icon to use based on the API provided iconCode separate from the main js file.

I used 'axios' to connect to the API

## How to use the app
Live demo of the application is available [here](https://zuhayramin.github.io/js-weather-app/)
