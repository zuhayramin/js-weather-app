# js-weather-app
I wanted to create a website which recieved and displayed data from an API.

This application gets data from the [open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com)

The HTML and CSS were kept straightforward because the main priority with this project was to connect to an external API and parse the information in a user-friendly way

## How to use the app
Live demo of the application is available [here](https://zuhayramin.github.io/js-weather-app/)

OR

1. Download the code from this repo
2. Open the HTML file
